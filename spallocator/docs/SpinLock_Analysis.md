## Key Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The SpinLock uses a three-phase hybrid approach:

1. **Active Spinning** (lines 91-98): Fast busy-wait with relaxed reads and yield
2. **Escalating Backoff** (lines 108-112): Progressive sleep delays to reduce contention
3. **Efficient Blocking** (line 117): Uses `atomic_flag::wait()` for CPU-efficient waiting

### Critical Components

**Lock State**: Single `std::atomic_flag lock_flag` (1 byte)
- `false` = unlocked (available)
- `true` = locked (held by a thread)

**Acquisition**: `test_and_set(memory_order_acquire)` - atomic read-modify-write
**Release**: `clear(memory_order_release)` - atomic write

---

## Detailed Method Analysis

### 1. `lock()` Method (Lines 69-121)

#### Algorithm Flow

```
1. Initialize randomized backoff (lines 73-83)
   - Thread-local RNG: 1-100 nanoseconds initial wait
   - Backoff counter starts at 0

2. Enter infinite loop (line 88)

3. Active spinning phase (lines 91-98)
   - Spin up to 100 times
   - Check flag with relaxed memory order (cheap)
   - Use yield() to avoid CPU monopolization
   - Break early if lock appears free

4. Acquisition attempt (line 101)
   - test_and_set() with acquire ordering
   - Returns atomic bool: was flag previously set?

5. If acquired (flag was false) (lines 102-104)
   - Add TSan annotation
   - Return (holding lock)

6. If failed (flag was true) (lines 107-119)
   a. First 10 attempts: Escalating backoff
      - Sleep for wait_time
      - Double wait time: wait_time += wait_time
      - Increment backoff_count

   b. After 10 attempts: Efficient blocking
      - Call atomic_flag::wait() with relaxed ordering
      - Blocks until notify_one() in unlock()
      - Loop back to step 3 and try again
```

#### Correctness Analysis

✅ **Mutual Exclusion**: CORRECT
- Only one thread can successfully execute `test_and_set()` and return
- All paths either return (holding lock) or loop back (not holding lock)
- No path returns without `test_and_set()` succeeding

✅ **Progress Guarantee**: CORRECT
- The `while (true)` loop ensures forward progress
- Eventually someone will acquire the lock
- No deadlock possible (lock is always released by `unlock()`)

✅ **Wait-After Acquisition**: CORRECT
- After `wait()` returns (line 117), code loops back to line 91
- Must still successfully execute `test_and_set()` before returning
- This fixes the critical bug from the previous version

#### Memory Ordering Analysis

```cpp
// Line 93: Relaxed for cheap spinning - no synchronization needed
if (!lock_flag.test(std::memory_order_relaxed))

// Line 101: Acquire establishes happens-before relationship
if (!lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire))

// Line 117: Relaxed for wait - synchronization happens on test_and_set
lock_flag.wait(true, std::memory_order_relaxed);
```

**Why relaxed is safe for spinning (line 93)**:
- We're only checking if the lock *appears* to be free
- Don't rely on this for synchronization
- Actual synchronization happens at `test_and_set(acquire)`
- Relaxed reads are much faster (no memory fence)
- Worst case: see stale value and retry (no correctness issue)

**Why relaxed is safe for wait (line 117)**:
- `wait()` just blocks until flag changes to false
- `wait()` doesn't provide synchronization guarantees itself
- After waking, we loop back and do `test_and_set(acquire)`
- The acquire operation provides the actual synchronization
- Using relaxed avoids unnecessary barriers on wake-up

#### Performance Characteristics

**Phase 1: Active Spinning**
- Up to 100 iterations × relaxed atomic loads
- Cost per iteration: ~1-5 CPU cycles (very cheap)
- Total: ~100-500 cycles worst case
- Uses `yield()` to allow other threads to run

**Phase 2: Escalating Backoff**
- Attempt 1: 1-100ns sleep
- Attempt 2: 2-200ns sleep
- Attempt 3: 4-400ns sleep
- ...
- Attempt 10: 512-51200ns sleep
- Cumulative worst case: ~51μs across 10 attempts
- Randomization prevents thundering herd

**Phase 3: Efficient Blocking**
- After 10 backoff attempts, use `wait()`
- No CPU usage while blocked
- Woken by `notify_one()` in `unlock()`
- Prevents busy-waiting in high contention

#### Potential Improvements

⚠️ **Minor: Inner spin loop count**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)  // Line 91
```
The count of 100 is arbitrary. This is a tuning parameter that could be:
- Too many on some architectures (wasted cycles)
- Too few on others (excessive test_and_set attempts)
- Consider making this configurable

⚠️ **Minor: Variable initialization**
```cpp
std::chrono::nanoseconds wait_time{dist(gen)};  // Line 83
int backoff_count = 0;  // Line 85
```
These are initialized outside the loop but only used inside. Could move inside for clarity, though current placement is a minor performance optimization.

**Verdict**: ✅ **CORRECT** - No correctness issues, excellent three-phase design

---

### 2. `try_lock()` Method (Lines 123-138)

#### Implementation

```cpp
bool try_lock()
{
    // Line 125: Quick check with relaxed ordering
    if (lock_flag.test(std::memory_order_relaxed))
    {
        return false; // Lock is already held elsewhere
    }

    // Line 131: Try to acquire with proper synchronization
    if (!lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire))
    {
        TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(this);
        return true; // Lock acquired
    }
    return false; // Failed to acquire
}
```

#### Correctness Analysis

✅ **Non-blocking**: CORRECT - Always returns immediately, never spins or waits

✅ **Memory Ordering**: CORRECT
- Relaxed test (line 125) is safe - just an optimization
- Acquire on test_and_set (line 131) provides proper synchronization when acquired

✅ **Spurious Failure**: ACCEPTABLE
- Between test (line 125) and test_and_set (line 131), lock could be released
- This means `try_lock()` might return false even when lock becomes available
- **This is allowed by the BasicLockable concept** - `try_lock()` is permitted to spuriously fail

#### Design Discussion

The initial `test()` at line 125 is an optimization to avoid the expensive `test_and_set()` read-modify-write operation when the lock is obviously held.

**Alternative (simpler but less optimal)**:
```cpp
bool try_lock()
{
    if (!lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire))
    {
        TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(this);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Both are correct. The current version is slightly more efficient when the lock is contended because it avoids the RMW operation.

**Verdict**: ✅ **CORRECT** - Proper non-blocking semantics with good optimization

---

### 3. `unlock()` Method (Lines 140-145)

#### Implementation

```cpp
void unlock()
{
    TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(this);      // Line 142
    lock_flag.clear(std::memory_order_release);  // Line 143
    lock_flag.notify_one();                   // Line 144
}
```

#### Correctness Analysis

✅ **Memory Ordering**: PERFECT
- `memory_order_release` ensures all writes in critical section are published
- Forms release-acquire pair with `memory_order_acquire` in `lock()`
- This is the foundation of the happens-before relationship

✅ **Notification**: CORRECT
- `notify_one()` wakes one waiting thread (if any)
- Must come after `clear()` so flag is false when waiter checks it

✅ **TSan Annotation**: CORRECTLY PLACED
- Must be before the release operation
- Tells ThreadSanitizer about the happens-before edge

#### Ordering Importance

The ordering `ANNOTATE → clear() → notify()` is critical:

1. **TSan annotation first**: Documents the synchronization point for race detection tools
2. **clear(release) next**: Publishes all prior writes and sets flag to false
3. **notify() last**: Wakes a waiter who will then see the false flag

**Why this order matters**:

If you swapped steps 2 and 3:
```cpp
lock_flag.notify_one();  // Wake someone
lock_flag.clear(...);    // THEN set to false
```

The woken thread might:
1. Wake up from `wait()`
2. Loop back and check the flag
3. See the flag is still true
4. Go back to sleep

This creates unnecessary contention and delays. The current order is optimal.

**Verdict**: ✅ **PERFECT** - Optimal ordering and complete correctness

## Memory Model Analysis

### Acquire-Release Synchronization

The implementation correctly establishes happens-before relationships through the C++ memory model:

```
Thread A (Lock Holder):          Thread B (Acquiring Lock):
─────────────────────            ──────────────────────────

  // Critical section
  shared_data = 42;
  other_data = 99;
  more_data = 123;

  unlock():
    TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE
    clear(memory_order_release) ──────────┐
    notify_one()                          │
                                          │ synchronizes-with
                                          │
                                          ↓
                                       lock():
                                         test_and_set(memory_order_acquire)
                                         TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER

                                       // All prior writes are visible:
                                       assert(shared_data == 42);    ✅
                                       assert(other_data == 99);     ✅
                                       assert(more_data == 123);     ✅
```

### Memory Ordering Guarantees

**Release operation in `unlock()` guarantees**:
- All memory operations before `unlock()` become visible
- No memory operations after `unlock()` can be reordered before it
- Writes "published" to other threads

**Acquire operation in `lock()` guarantees**:
- All memory operations after `lock()` see published writes
- No memory operations before `lock()` can be reordered after it
- Reads "synchronized" with release

**Together they form**: Total happens-before ordering for protected data

### Why Different Memory Orders Work

#### Relaxed for Spinning (line 93)

```cpp
if (!lock_flag.test(std::memory_order_relaxed))
```

**Safe because**:
1. We're only checking if the lock *appears* to be free
2. We don't rely on this for synchronization
3. The actual synchronization happens at `test_and_set(acquire)`
4. Relaxed reads have no memory fence (much faster)
5. Worst case: we see a stale "locked" value and retry
6. This cannot cause correctness issues, only minor inefficiency

**Performance benefit**: ~10-100x faster than acquire/release on some architectures

#### Relaxed for Wait (line 117)

```cpp
lock_flag.wait(true, std::memory_order_relaxed);
```

**Safe because**:
1. `wait()` blocks until flag becomes false
2. `wait()` itself doesn't provide synchronization
3. After waking, we loop back and do `test_and_set(acquire)`
4. The subsequent acquire operation provides synchronization
5. Using relaxed avoids unnecessary memory barriers on wake-up

**Performance benefit**: One less memory fence per contention event

## Race Condition Analysis

### Scenario 1: Multiple Acquirers (Normal Case)

```
Time  Thread A            Thread B            Thread C
────  ─────────────────   ─────────────────   ─────────────────
t0    lock()              -                   -
      test_and_set()
      → returns false
      ACQUIRES ✅

t1    <critical section>  lock()              -
                          test_and_set()
                          → returns true
                          (flag was true) ❌

t2    <critical section>  spin/backoff        lock()
                          (trying again)      test_and_set()
                                              → returns true ❌

t3    <critical section>  wait() called       wait() called
                          BLOCKS              BLOCKS

t4    unlock()            BLOCKED             BLOCKED
      clear(release)      (waiting)           (waiting)
      notify_one()

t5    -                   WAKES               BLOCKED
                          loops back to 91    (still waiting)
                          test_and_set()
                          → returns false
                          ACQUIRES ✅

t6    -                   <critical section>  BLOCKED

t7    -                   unlock()            BLOCKED
                          clear()
                          notify_one()

t8    -                   -                   WAKES
                                              test_and_set()
                                              → returns false
                                              ACQUIRES ✅

t9    -                   -                   <critical section>
```

**Result**: ✅ Perfect mutual exclusion - only one thread holds lock at any time

**Key observation**: The infinite loop ensures that even after `wait()` returns, threads must still successfully acquire via `test_and_set()` before proceeding.

### Scenario 2: Spurious Wakeup

```
Time  Thread A            Thread B
────  ─────────────────   ─────────────────
t0    lock()              -
      HOLDS LOCK

t1    <critical section>  lock()
                          reaches wait()

t2    <critical section>  wait() called
                          BLOCKS

t3    <critical section>  SPURIOUS WAKEUP!
                          (no notify was sent)
                          wait() returns

t4    <critical section>  loops back to line 91

t5    <critical section>  spin loop:
                          test(relaxed) → true
                          yields...

t6    <critical section>  test_and_set()
                          → returns true
                          (still locked) ❌

t7    <critical section>  backoff phase
                          sleep...

t8    <critical section>  test_and_set() again
                          → still true ❌

t9    <critical section>  backoff exhausted
                          wait() called again
                          BLOCKS

t10   unlock()            BLOCKED
      clear()
      notify_one()

t11   -                   WAKES (for real)
                          loops back
                          test_and_set()
                          → returns false
                          ACQUIRES ✅
```

**Result**: ✅ Spurious wakeups are handled correctly by looping back and re-checking

**Key observation**: The `while (true)` loop at line 88 is essential for handling spurious wakeups - we always verify we hold the lock before returning.

---

### Scenario 3: Lost Wakeup (Prevented)

```
Time  Thread A            Thread B
────  ─────────────────   ─────────────────
t0    <critical section>  backoff count = 10
      HOLDS LOCK          about to call wait()

t1    unlock()            NOT YET WAITING
      clear()             (between lines 114 and 117)

t2    notify_one()        STILL NOT WAITING
      (notification lost  (no one to wake)
       - no thread waiting)

t3    -                   NOW calls wait()
                          BUT flag is false!

t4    -                   wait(true, ...)
                          sees flag is false
                          returns IMMEDIATELY ✅
                          (doesn't block)

t5    -                   loops back to line 91

t6    -                   test_and_set()
                          → returns false
                          ACQUIRES ✅
```

**Result**: ✅ Lost wakeup is prevented because `wait()` checks the flag value immediately

**Key observation**: `atomic_flag::wait(true, ...)` means "wait while flag equals true". If the flag is already false when `wait()` is called, it returns immediately without blocking. This prevents the lost wakeup problem.

---

### Scenario 4: Thundering Herd (Mitigated)

```
Time  Thread A     Thread B     Thread C     Thread D     Thread E
────  ──────────   ──────────   ──────────   ──────────   ──────────
t0    HOLDS LOCK   wait()       wait()       wait()       wait()
                   BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED

t1    unlock()     BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED
      notify_one()

t2    -            WAKES        BLOCKED      BLOCKED      BLOCKED
                   wait: 47ns

t3    -            sleeping     WAKES        BLOCKED      BLOCKED
                                wait: 23ns

t4    -            wakes up     wakes up     WAKES        BLOCKED
                   test_and_set sleep...     wait: 91ns
                   ACQUIRES ✅

t5    -            HOLDS LOCK   blocked      sleeping     WAKES
                                             wait: 12ns

t6    -            unlock()     test_and_set wakes up     sleeping
                   notify_one() ACQUIRES ✅  blocked

(continues with staggered acquisition attempts...)
```

**Result**: ✅ Randomized backoff staggers retry attempts, preventing thundering herd

**Key observation**: Each thread uses a different random initial wait time (1-100ns), which gets doubled on each retry. This differentiation prevents all threads from simultaneously attempting to acquire the lock when it's released.

## Performance Analysis

### Time Complexity

| Scenario | Expected Operations | Worst Case | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| **No contention** | O(1) - 2 atomic ops | 2 atomic ops | test + test_and_set |
| **Low contention** | O(1) - 5-10 atomic ops | 15 atomic ops | Few retries, quick acquisition |
| **Medium contention** | O(1) - 20 atomic ops + backoff | 1000 atomic ops | Escalating backoff prevents spin waste |
| **High contention** | O(1) amortized | Unbounded | Blocking wait prevents CPU waste |

### Space Complexity

| Component | Size per Instance | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `lock_flag` | 1 byte | `std::atomic_flag` is smallest possible atomic |
| Thread-local RNG | ~8 bytes per thread | `std::minstd_rand` state |
| Thread-local dist | ~4 bytes per thread | `std::uniform_int_distribution` state |
| Stack locals (active lock call) | ~32 bytes | `wait_time`, `backoff_count`, loop counter |

**Total per-lock overhead**: **1 byte** (excellent!)

**Per-thread overhead**: ~12 bytes (RNG + distribution, allocated lazily on first use)

### CPU Efficiency

The three-phase design optimizes CPU usage:

**Phase 1 (Active Spinning)**:
- Uses `yield()` to allow OS scheduler to run other threads
- Prevents monopolizing a CPU core
- Still maintains low latency for quick lock releases

**Phase 2 (Escalating Backoff)**:
- Actively sleeps, allowing CPU to do other work
- Exponential increase prevents excessive retries
- Randomization spreads out retry attempts

**Phase 3 (Efficient Blocking)**:
- Uses futex-like wait (on platforms that support it)
- **Zero CPU usage** while blocked
- Woken by OS when lock is released
- Much better than pure spinlocks in high contention

### Comparison of Strategies

| Strategy | CPU Usage | Latency | Best For |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Pure spinlock** | 100% (one core) | Lowest | Very short locks, no contention |
| **Pure mutex** | 0% | Higher (syscall) | Long locks, unknown duration |
| **Hybrid (this)** | Variable | Low to medium | Short locks, varied contention |

The hybrid approach gets the best of both worlds:
- Low latency like spinlock when there's no contention
- Low CPU usage like mutex when there's high contention

---

### Cache Effects

**Lock acquisition (uncontended)**:
```
CPU Cache:
  [Lock flag] ──> L1 cache (1-4 cycles)
  test_and_set ──> 1 atomic RMW operation
  Total: ~5-10 cycles
```

**Lock acquisition (contended, TTAS)**:
```
CPU Cache:
  Spinning thread reads flag (relaxed):
    [Lock flag] ──> Shared in L1 across cores (read-only)
    No cache coherency traffic (just reads)

  When lock released:
    [Lock flag] cleared ──> Invalidates other cores' cache lines

  One thread succeeds at test_and_set:
    [Lock flag] ──> Exclusive in winner's L1
    Other threads see invalidation, loop back to read
```

**TTAS advantage**: During spinning, the flag is in shared read-only state across multiple cores. Only the final `test_and_set()` causes cache coherency traffic. This is much better than all cores constantly doing `test_and_set()` which would cause continuous cache line ping-ponging.

## ThreadSanitizer Integration

### Purpose

ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is a dynamic race detection tool that needs to understand synchronization primitives. For custom synchronization like our SpinLock, we must explicitly tell TSan about happens-before relationships.

### Annotation Placement

```cpp
// In lock() - lines 102-103
if (!lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire))
{
    TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(this);  // ✅ CORRECT placement
    return;
}

// In unlock() - lines 142-143
TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(this);  // ✅ CORRECT placement
lock_flag.clear(std::memory_order_release);
```

### Why This Placement is Correct

**In `lock()`**:
- Annotation comes *after* successful acquisition
- Only called when lock is actually acquired
- Tells TSan: "I just synchronized with whoever did HAPPENS_BEFORE"

**In `unlock()`**:
- Annotation comes *before* the release
- Always called when releasing
- Tells TSan: "Anyone who acquires after this synchronizes with me"

### Effect on Race Detection

**Without annotations**:
```
Thread A:                    Thread B:
  shared_data = 42;
  unlock() ─────────────────┐
                            │  No visible synchronization to TSan
                            │
                            └─────> lock()
                                    x = shared_data;

TSan reports: "RACE on shared_data!"
```

**With annotations**:
```
Thread A:                    Thread B:
  shared_data = 42;
  unlock():
    HAPPENS_BEFORE ─────────┐
                            │  TSan understands synchronization
                            │
                            └─────> lock():
                                      HAPPENS_AFTER
                                      x = shared_data;

TSan: "No race - properly synchronized"
```

### Macro Definitions

```cpp
#ifdef TSAN_ENABLED
extern "C" {
    void __tsan_acquire(void *addr);
    void __tsan_release(void *addr);
}
#define TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(addr) __tsan_release(addr)
#define TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(addr)  __tsan_acquire(addr)
#else
#define TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(addr)
#define TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(addr)
#endif
```

**Design notes**:
- Annotations compile to nothing when TSan is disabled (zero overhead in production)
- Only enabled when `__has_feature(thread_sanitizer)` is true
- Uses TSan's internal `__tsan_acquire` and `__tsan_release` functions
- The naming is a bit confusing: `__tsan_release` corresponds to HAPPENS_BEFORE

### Testing with TSan

With these annotations, running tests under ThreadSanitizer should:
- ✅ Report zero races for properly locked code
- ✅ Still detect genuine race conditions (e.g., accessing data without lock)
- ✅ Understand the happens-before edges created by lock/unlock

## Potential Improvements (Optional)

These are not correctness issues but potential enhancements for specific use cases.

### 1. Configurable Parameters

```cpp
class SpinLock
{
public:
    struct Config {
        int inner_spin_count = 100;      // How many times to spin before backoff
        int backoff_attempts = 10;       // How many backoff attempts before blocking
        int min_backoff_ns = 1;          // Minimum backoff time
        int max_backoff_ns = 100;        // Maximum initial backoff time
    };

    explicit SpinLock(Config cfg = {}) : config(cfg) {}

    // ... existing methods ...

private:
    Config config;
    std::atomic_flag lock_flag = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;
};
```

**Use case**: Tuning for specific workloads or platforms

### 2. Statistics Collection (Debug Mode)

```cpp
#ifdef SPINLOCK_STATS
    struct Stats {
        std::atomic<uint64_t> lock_acquisitions{0};
        std::atomic<uint64_t> contentions{0};
        std::atomic<uint64_t> backoff_events{0};
        std::atomic<uint64_t> wait_events{0};
        std::atomic<uint64_t> total_spin_count{0};
    };

    mutable Stats stats;

    const Stats& get_stats() const { return stats; }
    void reset_stats() {
        stats.lock_acquisitions = 0;
        stats.contentions = 0;
        stats.backoff_events = 0;
        stats.wait_events = 0;
        stats.total_spin_count = 0;
    }
#endif
```

**Use case**: Performance analysis and tuning

### 3. Adaptive Backoff

```cpp
// Adjust backoff based on recent contention history
class AdaptiveSpinLock
{
private:
    thread_local static uint32_t recent_contentions;

public:
    void lock()
    {
        // Fast path
        if (!lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
            recent_contentions = 0;  // Reset on success
            TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(this);
            return;
        }

        // Adaptive: Skip spinning if we've seen high contention recently
        if (recent_contentions > 10) {
            // Go straight to blocking
            while (lock_flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
                lock_flag.wait(true, std::memory_order_relaxed);
            }
            TSAN_ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(this);
            return;
        }

        recent_contentions++;

        // Normal backoff path...
    }
};
```

**Use case**: Automatically adapt to workload patterns

### 4. Platform-Specific Optimizations

```cpp
// CPU pause instruction for better spin performance
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__i386__)
    #define CPU_PAUSE() __builtin_ia32_pause()
#elif defined(__aarch64__) || defined(__arm__)
    #define CPU_PAUSE() asm volatile("yield" ::: "memory")
#else
    #define CPU_PAUSE() std::this_thread::yield()
#endif

// In spin loop:
while (lock_flag.test(std::memory_order_relaxed))
{
    CPU_PAUSE();  // More efficient than yield on many platforms
}
```

**Use case**: Squeeze out last bit of performance on specific CPUs

### 5. Lock Guard with Source Location

```cpp
#include <source_location>

template<typename Mutex>
class DebugLockGuard
{
public:
    explicit DebugLockGuard(
        Mutex& m,
        std::source_location loc = std::source_location::current())
        : mutex(m), location(loc)
    {
        auto start = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();
        mutex.lock();
        auto end = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();

        auto wait_time = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(
            end - start).count();

        if (wait_time > 100) {  // Warn if lock took > 100μs
            println("WARNING: Lock at {}:{} took {}μs to acquire",
                    location.file_name(), location.line(), wait_time);
        }
    }

    ~DebugLockGuard() {
        mutex.unlock();
    }

private:
    Mutex& mutex;
    std::source_location location;
};
```

**Use case**: Debugging lock contention issues

### 6. Exponential vs Additive Backoff

Current implementation uses additive doubling:
```cpp
wait_time += wait_time;  // 1→2→4→8→16→32→64→128→256→512
```

Alternative: True exponential backoff:
```cpp
wait_time *= 2;  // 1→2→4→8→16→32→64→128→256→512
```

Or capped exponential:
```cpp
wait_time = std::min(wait_time * 2, max_backoff);
```

**Trade-off**: True exponential grows faster but can lead to excessive delays. Current additive approach is a good middle ground.

### Final Verdict

**✅ PRODUCTION READY**

This SpinLock implementation is **correct, efficient, and well-designed** for its intended use case.

**Strengths**:
1. ✅ Completely correct mutual exclusion semantics
2. ✅ Proper C++ memory model usage (acquire/release)
3. ✅ Excellent performance for short critical sections
4. ✅ Three-phase approach balances latency and CPU usage
5. ✅ Minimal space overhead (1 byte)
6. ✅ ThreadSanitizer integration for race detection
7. ✅ STL compatible (BasicLockable concept)
8. ✅ Handles edge cases (spurious wakeup, lost wakeup)
9. ✅ Well-commented and documented
10. ✅ Platform-independent (C++20)

**Limitations**:
1. ⚠️ Not ideal for long critical sections (> 1μs)
2. ⚠️ Not a reader-writer lock (no concurrent reads)
3. ⚠️ No priority inheritance (can cause priority inversion)
4. ⚠️ Tuning parameters are hardcoded (100 spins, 10 backoffs)
5. ⚠️ No built-in debugging/statistics

### Recommended Use Cases

**✅ Excellent for**:
- Protecting small data structures (counters, flags, pointers)
- Short critical sections (< 100 CPU cycles)
- Read-modify-write operations
- Lock-free algorithm fallback paths
- Embedded systems (no syscalls, predictable latency)
- Memory-constrained environments

**❌ Avoid for**:
- Long critical sections (> 1μs)
- I/O operations inside lock
- Memory allocation inside lock
- Unknown or unpredictable critical section duration
- Very high contention (> 10 threads competing)
- Real-time systems requiring priority inheritance

### Migration Path

**From std::mutex to SpinLock**:
```cpp
// Before:
std::mutex mtx;
std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);

// After:
SpinLock lock;
std::lock_guard<SpinLock> guard(lock);
// Works seamlessly - BasicLockable concept
```

**From raw spinlock to this SpinLock**:
```cpp
// Before:
std::atomic_flag flag = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT;
while (flag.test_and_set(std::memory_order_acquire)) {
    // Busy wait forever
}
// ... critical section ...
flag.clear(std::memory_order_release);

// After:
SpinLock lock;
lock.lock();
// ... critical section ...
lock.unlock();
// Or better: std::lock_guard<SpinLock> guard(lock);
```
